üõ†Ô∏è Data Engineering Projects

Welcome to my collection of hands-on data engineering projects.
This repository is a personal playground for exploring real-world scenarios in data ingestion, streaming, processing, and analytics using modern tools like Apache Spark, Python, SQL, and AWS.

Each project is self-contained, with code, documentation, and sample datasets where applicable.
